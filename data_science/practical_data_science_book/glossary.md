# Important Terms for Data Science

- **Feature** also called attribute, input or variable. A feature is a column in a table/spreadsheet/data frame.

- **Target** also called output, outcome or dependent variable. Most statistical analysis or machine learning models try to predict an outcome based on selected features.
  Outcomes can be binary like yes/no or something like a price for a house, dependent on the features like size, location, number of rooms etc.

- **Record** also called an example, sample or instance is a single row in a table.

- **Mean** or **Average** is the sum of all the value divided by the number of values.

- **Median** or **50th percentile** is exactly the middle of the data. This means that one-half of the data is above and the other below. For this the data needs to be sorted.

> Depending on the data, the median and the mean can be very different.
> Many people only think of the mean as a value to represent the data, but it is sometimes not a very representative value.

- **Trimmed Mean** eliminates the distortion of the mean by dropping extreme value from the sample.

- **Percentile** is the value such that P percent lie below it. The 25th percentile means, that 25% of the data is below it.

- **Outlier** an extreme value, that is very different from most of the data. The median is mostly resistant to outliers, while the average can be heavily distorted by outliers.
