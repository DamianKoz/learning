# Data Science

Data science is the discipline of retrieving knowledge out of data.

# Unstructured data

Big Data is a popular topic these days, as companies continue to generate vast amounts of data on a daily basis.

The problem is, that most of it is in an unstructured format, such as text, images and voice recordings.

The Internet of Things is significant contributor to the growth of data, as the devices and sensors generate a large amount of data.

One goal of data science is to tame the unstructured data, and to extract actionable insights from it.

For this, the raw data needs to be processed and manipulated into a structured format.

# Structured data

Structured data comes mostly in two ways: **numerical** and **categorical**.

Numerical data (also known as quantitative data), is, as the name already suggests, data which is expressed in numbers.

Which means, that you can carry out arithmetical operations on it.

Numerical data itself is split into **discrete** and **continuous** data.

**Discrete Data** consists of integers, such as counts. This count could be "How many people die yearly" or "How many students are in the university".

**Continuous Data** can take any value in an intervall. Examples are weather temperature, height and weight of people, or the speed of a vehicle.

On the other hand there is **categorical data**, which can only take on a set of possible values, like "level of education" or "Smoking status" etc.
