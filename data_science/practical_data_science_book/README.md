Data science is the discipline of retrieving knowledge out of data.

# Unstructured data

Big Data is a popular topic these days, as companies continue to generate vast amounts of data on a daily basis.

The problem is, that most of it is in an unstructured format, such as text, images and voice recordings.

The Internet of Things is significant contributor to the growth of data, as the devices and sensors generate a large amount of data.

One goal of data science is to tame the unstructured data, and to extract actionable insights from it.

For this, the raw data needs to be processed and manipulated into a structured format.
